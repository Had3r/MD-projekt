## Basic principles of website designing that I use in my projects (source: Jonas Schmedtmann):

### Typography

1. Use a font-size between 15 and 25 pixels for body text.
2. Big font-sizes for headlines (no limits).
3. For a big headline decrease the font weight of text.
	(This ensures that the text doesn't steal too much attention from the rest of the content. 
	And it makes the text look less bulky and more modern and elegant.)
4. Use a line spacing between 120% and 150% of the font size. (vertical distance between lines)
5. 45 to 90 characters per line is the optimal line length that is easy to read.
6. Use good fonts
